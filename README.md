# Simple-C-Projects
This is a repository of my projects done in C# they are all relatively simple, but there's a lot.

Just about everthing here is self explanitory.  

Feel free to look through them and run them in visual studio. You can count vowels in a phrase, tally the eggs from your chickens, play rock paper scissors, or even become the literal embodiment of a stop sign.
